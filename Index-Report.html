<h1>Web Application Security Vulnerability Report</h1>

<p><strong>Target Website:</strong> https://rphs.nclack.k12.or.us</p>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong> Absence of Anti-CSRF Token and PII Disclosure</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>1. Absence of Anti-CSRF Token</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a vulnerability that allows an attacker
        to trick an authenticated user’s browser into submitting unintended requests.
        The application does not appear to implement anti-CSRF protections on at least
        one state-accessible endpoint.
    </p>

    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <div class="evidence">
        <p>
            Security testing identified the absence of anti-CSRF tokens on the following page:
        </p>
        <code>
GET https://rphs.nclack.k12.or.us/about-us/staff-calendar
        </code>
        <p>
            Requests associated with this page do not include a unique, server-validated
            anti-CSRF token, indicating that request origin and user intent are not verified.
        </p>
        <code>
CWE ID: 352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
        </code>
    </div>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>
        If a user is authenticated to the site, an attacker could potentially cause
        unauthorized requests to be executed by luring the user to a malicious webpage.
        This may result in unintended actions being performed under the victim’s session.
    </p>

    <h3>Remediation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement unique, unpredictable anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests.</li>
        <li>Validate tokens server-side before processing requests.</li>
        <li>Consider validating <code>Origin</code> or <code>Referer</code> headers as an additional safeguard.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>2. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Disclosure</h2>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Disclosure occurs when sensitive
        information is exposed through publicly accessible application responses.
        Passive analysis identified sensitive numeric data returned from multiple pages.
    </p>

    <h3>Evidence</h3>
    <div class="evidence">
        <p>
            PII was detected in responses from the following endpoints:
        </p>
        <code>
GET https://rphs.nclack.k12.or.us/fs/pages/athletics
GET https://rphs.nclack.k12.or.us/fs/pages/calendar
GET https://rphs.nclack.k12.or.us/fs/pages/news
        </code>
        <p>
            The exposed data matched patterns consistent with credit-card-related identifiers:
        </p>
        <code>
Evidence: 4427313810781538
CWE ID: 359
WASC ID: 13
Source: Passive (PII Disclosure)
        </code>
    </div>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>
        Disclosure of PII on publicly accessible pages may result in privacy violations,
        reputational damage, and potential regulatory non-compliance. Even inadvertent
        exposure increases organizational risk.
    </p>

    <h3>Remediation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove all sensitive data from public-facing responses.</li>
        <li>Ensure backend logic does not expose PII to unauthenticated users.</li>
        <li>Apply strict data-handling and output-filtering controls.</li>
    </ul>
